# Extended in the plugin :
1- Registering Units (Non Hirerchial Taxonomy) in the Products Dropdown List in order to create,read,update and delete units.
2- Sending Product Units and Rules (containing step,max,min) along with the products API. 
3- "products/units" API to list added units (use wc/v1).
